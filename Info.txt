Features
- iTunes' NSTableView* style
- Auto column widths (average width of column cell contents, but not less than column header cell content width)
- Cell content overflow truncation with tail ellipsis
- Scrolling with vertically fixed and horizontally scrolled column headers

* Strictly speaking, iTunes isn't a Cocoa app, and thus doesn't use NSTableViews.

To Dos
- Column resizing (Move to Features when done)
- Column sorting
- Test table layout combinations
- Compatibility with "other" browsers
